# Pong
Pong Game
This game is developed using Python. Turtle module is used for GUI.
In this game we have one ball which starts from centre in random direction and two paddles on left and right side.
Ball bounces when it touches floor or ceiling.
It can be played by two players where one player moves using 'w' and 's', while the other uses 'Up' and 'Down' key to move paddle up and down.
If ball goes out of play from left side then right side player gets a point and vice versa.
The player who gets 10 points first wins the game.
